üéÆ **Guess the Number Game in Python**

Excited to share a simple Python program I built for a mini assignment! üêç In this "Guess the Number" game, the computer randomly selects a number within a range, and you have 5 chances to guess it. The program provides hints if your guess is greater or lesser. Give it a try and see if you can win! üíªüöÄ

## GUESS THE NUMBER
- THE RANGE OF THE NUMBER IS IN BETWEEN 0 AND 100
- YOU HAVE ONLY 5 CHANCES TO GUESS THE NUMBER
- IF YOUR CHOICE IS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER THEN THE COMPUTER SHOWS GREATER
- IF YOUR CHOICE IS LESSER THAN THE NUMBER THEN THE COMPUTER SHOWS LESSER

## Cheat code
- Use 1234 to see the number.
